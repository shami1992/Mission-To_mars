4. Create a list containing the dictionary of the full-resolution image URL string and title for each hemisphere image. 

## Step 2 creating the HTML and creating a function to scrape the images with the scraping.py file:

1. Create a scraping.py file contains code that retrieves the full-resolution image URL and title for each hemisphere image.
2. Make a Mongo database is updated to contain the full-resolution image URL and title for each hemisphere image.
3. Create the index.html file contains code that will display the full-resolution image URL and title for each hemisphere image.
